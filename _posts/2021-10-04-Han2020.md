[Low Expression of APOB mRNA or Its Hypermethylation Predicts Favorable Overall Survival in Patients with Low-Grade Glioma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7394594/)

## Background
This study was performed to explore the clinical and prognostic significance of APOB mRNA expression, DNA methylation and APOB mutation in patients with low-grade glioma (LGG).

## Methods
Bioinformatic analysis was conducted using genomic, clinical and survival data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. Serum APOB protein levels were measured via immunoturbidimetry in 150 patients with LGG and 100 healthy controls from Hubei General Hospital.

## Results
There was a negative association between the levels of APOB mRNA and DNA methylation (r=âˆ’0.355, P<0.0001) in patients with LGG from the TCGA database. Additionally, LGG patients with low levels of APOB mRNA exhibited better overall survival (OS) than those with high levels of APOB mRNA (HR=0.637, P=0.0085). The survival time of LGG patients with APOB hypermethylation was markedly longer than that of patients with APOB hypomethylation (HR=0.423, P=0.0185). The prognostic significance of APOB mRNA and DNA methylation was also validated with the CGGA cohort, and a similar conclusion was reached. APOB gene mutations were observed in 3% of patients with LGG from the TCGA database, and no association was detected between APOB mutations and OS (P=0.164). Furthermore, the levels of APOB protein were much lower in patients with LGG than in normal individuals (P=0.0022), and the expression of APOB protein was markedly different among groups when stratified by histological type (P<0.0001) and histological-molecular classification (P<0.0001).

## Conclusion
APOB mRNA expression is negatively regulated by DNA methylation in patients with LGG. Low expression or hypermethylation of APOB might predict relatively favorable survival in patients with LGG.
