Background: The Perilipin (PLIN) family of genes were previously shown to be involved in the formation and degradation of Lipid Droplets (LDs). In addition, they may play important roles in the development and progression of breast cancer. However, the prognostic value of PLIN family members in breast cancer patients remains unclear. Methods: Mutations and copy number alterations of PLIN family genes in breast cancer were examined using the cBioportal for Cancer Genomics. In addition, the expression patterns of PLIN family genes were explored using the UCSC Xena online tool. Finally, the Kaplan-Meier Plotter was used to investigate the prognostic value of PLIN family genes in breast cancer. Results: The findings revealed a low frequency of genetic alterations and amplification was the most frequent change in the PLIN family genes. Additionally, there was an increase in the expression of Perilipin 3 (PLIN3) in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissues. However, expression of the other genes in the PLIN family was significantly lower in breast cancer tissues compared to normal breast tissues. Moreover, there was an increase in the expression levels of Perilipin 1 (PLIN1), PLIN3, Perilipin 4 (PLIN4) and Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) in the luminal A and luminal B subgroups. On the other hand, the expression of Perilipin 2 (PLIN2) was elevated in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and basal-like subgroups. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier Plotter analysis demonstrated that high expression of PLIN1 might predict a longer Overall Survival (OS) in patients with breast cancer while overexpression of PLIN2 indicated poor OS of breast cancer patients. Conclusion: The findings from this study indicated that genes in the PLIN family were aberrantly expressed in breast cancer and may serve as novel therapeutic targets as well as prognostic biomarkers for the disease.
